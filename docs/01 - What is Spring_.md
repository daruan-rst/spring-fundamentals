# What is Spring?

Spring is a framework for building enterprise-level Java, Groovy and Kotlin based applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to develop robust, maintainable, and high-performing applications.

It has been used to develop and mantain high-performing applicaitons using POJOs (Plain old Java Objects) and servlet containers that speed up development. Aside from that, Spring can also be used in conjunction with techniques like aspect-oriented programming (AOP) andd dependency injection to simplify development and reduce application testing and maintenance costs.

## Key Features of Spring

1. **Dependency Injection (DI):**  
   Enables loose coupling by managing the dependencies of objects through configuration, reducing boilerplate code and increasing testability.

2. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):**  
   Allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) from your business logic.

3. **Modularity and Scalability:**  
   Spring provides modular components, allowing developers to use only what they need, such as Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, and more.

4. **Simplifies Enterprise Java Development:**  
   Spring abstracts complexities in Java Enterprise (JEE) and provides alternatives to cumbersome APIs like JPA, JMS, and transactions.

5. **Wide Ecosystem and Integration:**  
   Supports integration with various technologies like Hibernate, JPA, JDBC, and even non-Java components through its vast ecosystem.

6. **Inversion of control:**  
    Spring uses IoC to manage the lifecycle and configuration of application objects. This is achieved through dependendy injection which allows developers to define dependencies externally rather than hard-coding themn within applicaiton.
